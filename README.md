## Deployment üì¶

Once you have done with your setup. You need to put your website online!

I highly recommend to use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to achieve this on the EASIEST WAY

Because this template use Webpack maybe you can get errors during deployment, Please watch my step-by-step video tutorial to successfully upload your Simplefolio Website on Netlify!
